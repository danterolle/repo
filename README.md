# REPO (Repository Extraction and Parsing Operations)

This repository is a reimplementation written in Python (3.11) of [the following project for ParrotOS](https://github.com/danterolle/packages-filter).

It is all been redesigned and written again to cope with the new structural change in the ParrotOS repositories, particularly because of the Debian 12-based version 6.0.

It works better, is better managed, and will be further improved.

So, these scripts allow you to download the Packages file from any Debian repository (including ParrotOS), format it as needed to get a JSON format easily usable in the web.
